	Build a circuit that has two 3-bit inputs that computes the bitwise-OR of the two vectors, 
    the logical-OR of the two vectors, and the inverse (NOT) of both vectors.
    Place the inverse of b in the upper half of out_not (i.e., bits [5:3]), and the inverse of a in the lower half.
    Bitwise calculation means the calculation are done bit-wise 
    This will result in BIT numbers
    Whereas
    Logical Calculation means the calculations are done logically
    This will result in TRUE (1) or FALSE (0)
